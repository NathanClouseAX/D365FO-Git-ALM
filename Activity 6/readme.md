# Activity 6 â€“ Branching Strategies

Propose a branching strategy for the following project descriptions:

## Build a website for a small business

You have been hired to create a website for a small business. The website should include information about the business, their products or services, and how to contact them. You will need to create a Git repository to manage the code for the website. You will need to create multiple branches in the repository for each feature of the website (e.g. homepage, products page, contact page). Each student in the group will be responsible for creating and testing a different branch. Once each branch is complete and tested, they will need to be merged into the main branch to create the final website.

## Create a game 

You will be creating a game using Git to manage the code. Each student in the group will be responsible for a different feature of the game (e.g. player movement, enemy AI, sound effects). You will need to create multiple branches in the repository for each feature. Once each feature is complete and tested, they will need to be merged into the main branch to create the final game.

## Develop a mobile app 

You will be developing a mobile app using Git to manage the code. Each student in the group will be responsible for a different feature of the app (e.g. user interface, database integration, user authentication). You will need to create multiple branches in the repository for each feature. Once each feature is complete and tested, they will need to be merged into the main branch to create the final app.

## Build a calculator 

You will be building a calculator using Git to manage the code. Each student in the group will be responsible for a different aspect of the calculator (e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). You will need to create multiple branches in the repository for each aspect of the calculator. Once each aspect is complete and tested, they will need to be merged into the main branch to create the final calculator.

## Design a website template 

You will be designing a website template using Git to manage the code. Each student in the group will be responsible for a different part of the template (e.g. header, footer, navigation). You will need to create multiple branches in the repository for each part of the template. Once each part is complete and tested, they will need to be merged into the main branch to create the final template.
